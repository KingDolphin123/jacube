# Hi there! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

## Overview

This project implements a modern and visually captivating artist landing page using React, CSS, and Framer Motion. The page is designed to deliver an engaging user experience with animations triggered by scroll and viewport visibility. Key elements include:

- A hero section featuring a video playback and numerous visual elements including text and icons.
- Section titles that feature scrolling animations.
- Scalable and dynamic sections including "Music" and "About" at the moment
- High responsiveness tailored for mobile and desktop devices.
- An Esther (easter) egg if you look through the code ðŸ˜ƒ

## Customization

### Adjust Animation Timing

You can tweak the animation duration and easing by modifying the `transition` property in the `motion.div` elements. Example:

```jsx
transition={{ duration: 2, ease: "easeOut" }}
```

### Modify Layout

To adjust the layout for specific devices, edit the `isMobile` checks and CSS styles in `About.css`:

```css
.logoAbout {
  padding-top: 2vw;
}
```

## Future Improvements

- Add more interactive animations for other elements.
- Enhance accessibility features for better usability.
- Implement lazy loading for images to improve performance.
